# HN Docs

All the documentation about HN Software workflows

## How to RUN

Run with `npx docsify serve ./docs`

## Todos

- Add HN logo to coverpage when we have it
- Add HN logo to icon configuartion when we have it
- Maybe dockerize so docker compose up will automatically open browser and nothing need to be installed except docker
- Maybe switch to docsify-themeable theme. It looks good.
- Tell in docs prismjs is used for code highlight. Supported languages: https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages Add anything if needed via cdn
- Document customer workflow
- Document company ethics like 5 minutes before meetings
- Maybe document tools we use | all technologies + google meets, signal etc.
